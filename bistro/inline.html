        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new 
        cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide 
        cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed 
        in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely 
        set to the target temperature you want the food 
        to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, 
        <i>Jeff Potter</i> describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature 
        poaching</q>.</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon 
        with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef 
        table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.</p>

        <p><em>Warning:</em> Sous vide cooked salmon is not 
        pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have 
        immunity issues.</p>
